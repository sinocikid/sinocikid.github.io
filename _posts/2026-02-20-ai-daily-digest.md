## 🏆 Must Read Today

🥇 **Gemini 3.1 Pro**

[Gemini 3.1 Pro](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/19/gemini-31-pro/#atom-everything) — simonwillison.net · 21h ago · 🤖 AI / ML

> This article introduces Google's Gemini 3.1 Pro model, highlighting its competitive pricing and performance. The model is priced at $2/million input and $12/million output for under 200,000 tokens, or $4/$18 for 200,000 to 1,000,000 tokens. This makes it less than half the price of Claude Opus 4.6, despite achieving very similar benchmark scores. Additionally, Gemini 3.1 Pro boasts improved SVG animation performance compared to its predecessor, Gemini 3 Pro. The model offers a cost-effective alternative to high-end AI models with comparable capabilities.

💡 **Why read it**: It provides a concise comparison of a new AI model's performance and pricing against a leading competitor, offering valuable insights for AI developers and users.

🥈 **Quoting Thariq Shihipar**

[Quoting Thariq Shihipar](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/20/thariq-shihipar/#atom-everything) — simonwillison.net · 7h ago · ⚙️ Engineering

> This article discusses how prompt caching is crucial for the feasibility of long-running agentic AI products like Claude Code. Prompt caching enables the reuse of computation from previous roundtrips, significantly decreasing both latency and operational costs. Claude Code's entire system harness is built around this mechanism, with a high prompt cache hit rate directly contributing to cost reduction. This efficiency also allows for more generous rate limits on subscription plans, and alerts are actively run on prompt cache performance. Prompt caching is a critical technical strategy for optimizing performance and cost-effectiveness in complex, iterative AI applications.

💡 **Why read it**: It highlights a crucial, often overlooked technical detail—prompt caching—that underpins the economic viability and performance of advanced AI agentic products.

🏷️ prompt caching, AI agents, LLM optimization, latency

🥉 **ActivityPub**

[ActivityPub](https://nesbitt.io/2026/02/20/activitypub.html) — nesbitt.io · 15h ago · ⚙️ Engineering

> This article humorously describes ActivityPub as a federated protocol for announcing 'pub activities.' It states that the protocol was first standardized in 1714. Despite its purported ancient origins, it is still in use today across 46,000 active instances. The article presents ActivityPub as a remarkably long-lived and widely adopted federated protocol.

💡 **Why read it**: It presents a surprising and humorous historical detail about a widely used federated protocol, challenging common perceptions of technology timelines.

🏷️ ActivityPub, federated web, protocol, humor
