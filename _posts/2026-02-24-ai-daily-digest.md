### 10. Vulnerability as a Service

[Vulnerability as a Service](https://herman.bearblog.dev/vulnerability-as-a-service/) — **herman.bearblog.dev** · 3h ago · ⭐ 24/30

> The article briefly touches upon the concept of "Vulnerability as a Service," implicitly discussing the commodification of software vulnerabilities. While the provided text is minimal ("OpenClaw being dumb"), the title suggests a focus on how vulnerabilities are discovered, exploited, and potentially sold or offered as a service. This often involves automated tools or platforms. The piece likely aims to shed light on the evolving landscape of cybercrime where access to vulnerabilities is productized, potentially exemplified by issues with tools like "OpenClaw."

### 15. Agentic swarms are an org-chart delusion

[Agentic swarms are an org-chart delusion](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/agentic-swarms-are-an-org-chart-delusion/) — **joanwestenberg.com** · 13h ago · ⭐ 27/30

> The article critiques the "agentic swarm" vision of productivity, arguing it's a deceptive and comfortingly familiar corporate hierarchy applied to AI. This vision proposes replacing the bottom layers of an existing corporate hierarchy with AI agents while keeping humans as supervisors. The author suggests this familiar structure should be an immediate "red flag." The article posits that viewing agentic swarms as merely an "org chart with robots" is a fundamental delusion that fails to leverage the true potential or address the unique challenges of AI integration.
