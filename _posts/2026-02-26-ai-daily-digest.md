🥇 **Claude Code Remote Control**
[Claude Code Remote Control](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/25/claude-code-remote-control/#atom-everything) — simonwillison.net · 21h ago · 🤖 AI / ML
> Claude Code has introduced a new "Remote Control" feature, enabling users to run a session on their local machine and interact with it via Claude Code's web, iOS, or desktop interfaces. This allows sending prompts to the local session, facilitating AI-assisted code execution and interaction. The feature is noted to be "janky" in its initial release, with some users encountering "Remote Control is not enabled for your account" errors. This new capability aims to bridge local development environments with Claude's AI assistance.
💡 **Why read it**: It introduces a significant new feature for AI-assisted coding, allowing remote interaction with local development environments via Claude Code.

🥈 **Greg Knauss: ‘Lose Myself’**
[Greg Knauss: ‘Lose Myself’](https://www.eod.com/blog/2026/02/lose-myself/) — daringfireball.net · 16h ago · 💡 Opinion / Essays
> This article argues that interacting with Large Language Models (LLMs) via natural language, while technically an abstraction, represents a fundamental, "quantum" shift rather than just another layer. It likens this change to the industrialization of food production, where a factory-made Ding Dong is qualitatively different from a handcrafted gâteau au chocolat. The core point is that this new level of abstraction profoundly alters the nature of interaction and the resulting output, moving beyond mere technical truth.
💡 **Why read it**: It offers a thought-provoking perspective on the transformative impact of LLMs, distinguishing their abstraction from mere technical layers to a fundamental shift in interaction.
🏷️ LLM abstraction, AI philosophy, Industrialization, Human-AI interaction

### 3. Pluralistic: If you build it (and it works), Trump will come (and take it) (26 Feb 2026)
[Pluralistic: If you build it (and it works), Trump will come (and take it) (26 Feb 2026)](https://pluralistic.net/2026/02/26/hanged-for-a-sheep/) — **pluralistic.net** · 4h ago · ⭐ 25/30
> This Pluralistic post, titled "If you build it (and it works), Trump will come (and take it)," primarily argues that Trump's interest in Big Tech is for it to "win," rather than to ensure fair play. The article is a link aggregation, touching on various topics including legal battles like Harpercollins vs. libraries, intellectual property disputes such as Rothfuss and Firefly, and Apple's stance on encryption. The overarching theme suggests a critical view of power dynamics and corporate behavior in the tech and publishing industries.

> This article, quoting Citrini Research, posits that the U.S. economy has spent the last fifty years constructing a massive "rent-extraction layer" by exploiting inherent human limitations. These limitations include finite time, dwindling patience, reliance on brand familiarity over diligence, and a willingness to accept suboptimal prices to avoid minor inconveniences like "more clicks." Trillions of dollars in enterprise value have been built upon the persistence of these human constraints. This suggests a system designed to profit from user friction and cognitive biases.

### 5. This time is different
[This time is different](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/this-time-is-different/) — **shkspr.mobi** · 2h ago · ⭐ 24/30
> This article expresses skepticism about current technological hype, particularly around Artificial Intelligence, by drawing parallels to a long list of past overhyped and ultimately failed or niche technologies. It enumerates examples such as 3D TV, AMP, Augmented Reality, Blockchain, Metaverse, NFTs, Quantum Computing, Quibi, and Stadia. The author observes that the same individuals who enthusiastically promoted these previous "bollocks" are now similarly fixated on AI, suggesting a pattern of irrational exuberance that often precedes disappointment.

### 7. Terry Godier: ‘Phantom Obligation’
[Terry Godier: ‘Phantom Obligation’](https://www.terrygodier.com/phantom-obligation) — **daringfireball.net** · 15h ago · ⭐ 21/30
> The article highlights Terry Godier's concept of 'phantom obligation' experienced when returning to an RSS feed reader after a period of absence. This feeling is described as a sense of guilt, akin to walking into an empty room where one expects people to have been waiting, but realizing no one ever was. Godier explores the psychological aspect of digital consumption, where the expectation of new content creates a perceived duty to catch up, even when the interaction is asynchronous and impersonal. This reflection delves into the unique emotional landscape of managing digital information streams. The core takeaway is a thoughtful insight into the subtle psychological pressures associated with consuming digital content.

### 9. Google API Keys Weren't Secrets. But then Gemini Changed the Rules.
[Google API Keys Weren't Secrets. But then Gemini Changed the Rules.](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/26/google-api-keys/#atom-everything) — **simonwillison.net** · 10h ago · ⭐ 24/30
> This article highlights a critical security vulnerability concerning Google API keys, revealing that Gemini and Google Maps (among other services) share the same API key infrastructure. Historically, Google Maps API keys were designed for public exposure, often embedded directly in web pages. However, the introduction of Gemini means these shared keys can now facilitate access to private files and incur billable API requests, fundamentally changing their security requirements. This creates a significant risk where publicly exposed keys for one service could compromise sensitive data or lead to unexpected costs for another.

### 10. Amerika runt binnenkort onze BTW
[Amerika runt binnenkort onze BTW](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/btw-as-an-american-service/) — **berthub.eu** · 1h ago · ⭐ 24/30
> The article raises alarms about the increasing outsourcing of critical Dutch government IT infrastructure to American companies. It highlights that after the management of the DigiD platform was transferred to a US firm, the Dutch tax service (BTW) now plans to have its entire VAT platform managed by an American company. This trend signifies a significant shift of sensitive national data and operational control to foreign entities, despite initial intentions to keep such systems domestic. The author argues that this represents a concerning loss of national sovereignty and data control over essential public services.

### 11. Git in Postgres
[Git in Postgres](https://nesbitt.io/2026/02/26/git-in-postgres.html) — **nesbitt.io** · 5h ago · ⭐ 26/30
> This article poses a conceptual question: "Instead of using git as a database, what if you used a database as a git?" It suggests exploring the paradigm of leveraging a robust database system like PostgreSQL to implement version control functionalities. This approach would involve using PostgreSQL's transactional capabilities, indexing, and structured data storage to manage changes, history, and branching. This could potentially offer different advantages over traditional Git's file-based, content-addressable storage.

### 12. tldraw issue: Move tests to closed source repo
[tldraw issue: Move tests to closed source repo](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/25/closed-tests/#atom-everything) — **simonwillison.net** · 17h ago · ⭐ 24/30
> This article discusses the concerning trend where comprehensive open-source test suites are proving sufficient to re-implement an entire library from scratch, potentially in a different programming language. This phenomenon poses significant "worrying implications" for open-source projects that rely on commercial business models for sustainability. The article cites tldraw, an outstanding collaborative drawing tool, as an example project grappling with the strategic decision to potentially move its test suite to a closed-source repository to protect its commercial viability.

### 15. Quoting Benedict Evans
[Quoting Benedict Evans](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/26/benedict-evans/#atom-everything) — **simonwillison.net** · 11h ago · ⭐ 21/30
> The article quotes Benedict Evans, who critiques OpenAI's current product-market fit, arguing that if users engage with AI models only a couple of times a week, the technology hasn't fundamentally changed their lives. Evans interprets OpenAI's acknowledgment of a 'capability gap' between model abilities and user adoption as an avoidance of admitting a lack of clear product-market fit. This suggests that despite advanced capabilities, AI models struggle with widespread, daily utility for the average user. The core takeaway is that the true impact and adoption of AI depend on solving the 'product-market fit' challenge, not just advancing raw capabilities.
🏷️ LLM adoption, AI utility, OpenAI, Benedict Evans
