🥇 **AI is a NAND Maximiser**

[AI is a NAND Maximiser](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2026/02/ai-is-a-nand-maximiser/) — shkspr.mobi · 4h ago · ⚙️ Engineering

> The article highlights the severe impact of AI companies' demand for computer chips on the broader industry. Specifically, NVIDIA's Vera Rubin chips, each requiring 20+TB SSDs, could consume approximately 20% of last year's global NAND production capacity if tens of millions of units ship. This massive demand for NAND, a critical microchip component, is creating significant supply chain strain. The insatiable need for high-capacity storage components like NAND flash by the AI sector poses a substantial challenge to global chip availability for other industries.

💡 **Why read it**: It quantifies a critical, immediate impact of AI's hardware demands on global chip supply, specifically NAND production, affecting the entire tech industry.

🏷️ AI demand, NAND, SSD, chip shortage

🥈 **A Few Rambling Observations on Care**

[A Few Rambling Observations on Care](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/observations-on-care/) — blog.jim-nielsen.com · 22h ago · 💡 Opinion / Essays

> This article contrasts "taste" and "care" as paramount skills in the AI era, advocating for "care" in product development. It questions the measurability of care, whether scale inherently diminishes it, and if reducing product conversations solely to numerical metrics leads to its loss. The author suggests that "care" appears antithetical to the reductive nature of quantification. Ultimately, the piece implies that genuine product quality and user satisfaction might stem more from an unquantifiable sense of "care" than from measurable data or subjective "taste."

💡 **Why read it**: It offers a philosophical yet practical perspective on the qualitative aspects of product development, like 'care,' in an increasingly data-driven and AI-centric world.

🏷️ AI, Product Design, Care, Taste

🥉 **Frigate with Hailo for object detection on a Raspberry Pi**

[Frigate with Hailo for object detection on a Raspberry Pi](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/frigate-with-hailo-for-object-detection-on-a-raspberry-pi/) — jeffgeerling.com · 20h ago · ⚙️ Engineering

> The author explores upgrading their Frigate server for security camera object detection, currently running on a Raspberry Pi CM4 with a Coral TPU. Raspberry Pi now offers AI HAT+'s for the Raspberry Pi 5, featuring built-in NPUs like the Hailo-8L. The article likely details an experiment or setup guide for integrating Frigate with a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Hailo AI HAT+ to leverage its NPU for improved object detection performance. This setup promises a more integrated and potentially more efficient local object detection solution compared to previous configurations.

💡 **Why read it**: It provides practical, technical insights into upgrading a home security NVR system using a Raspberry Pi 5 and a Hailo AI HAT+ for enhanced, local object detection.

### 3. Typing without having to type

[Typing without having to type](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/18/typing/#atom-everything) — **simonwillison.net** · 22h ago · ⭐ 23/30

> A programmer with over 25 years of experience is reconsidering his long-standing resistance to type hints and strong typing in programming. Previously, he avoided strong typing because it slowed down iteration, especially in REPL environments crucial for his productivity. However, with the advent of coding agents now performing the actual "typing" work, the benefits of explicitly defining types, such as improved code clarity and maintainability, have become significantly more attractive. The article concludes that AI coding agents fundamentally shift the cost-benefit analysis of strong typing, making it a more appealing practice for modern developers.
