### 12. Wrapping Code Comments

[Wrapping Code Comments](https://matklad.github.io/2026/02/21/wrapping-code-comments.html) — **matklad.github.io** · 15h ago · ⭐ 16/30

> The article addresses the complexities of wrapping code comments, particularly in Rust, to maintain readability and adhere to style guides like `rustfmt`. It highlights `rustfmt`'s default behavior of rewrapping comments at 100 characters, which can disrupt manually formatted lists or code examples within `//` comments. While `rustfmt` treats `///` and `//!` doc comments differently, its `format_code_in_doc_comments = true` option can still be problematic. The author discusses workarounds like using `//-` for comments that should not be wrapped, though this isn't natively supported by `rustfmt` and often requires editor-specific configurations via `rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.extraArgs`. Ultimately, effective comment wrapping necessitates understanding tool-specific behaviors and adopting conventions to balance automated formatting with manual readability needs.
